# HiveUDF

This repo contains the original code used to build the HiveUDF.
It's based on this example: https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.0.0/using-hiveql/content/hive_create_udf.html

Note: To build the UDF, you will need to provide hive-exec*.jar and hadoop-common*.jar.  These dependencies are not included in this repo, but can be extracted from your existing Hadoop installation. You do not need these dependencies to run within a Databricks cluster.
